## Content Creation Software: Autodesk Maya 2017+ ##

**Autodesk Maya** does not support direct export for **glTF** at this time. Utilizing the babylon.js plugin is one of the easiest ways as of July 2023. This plugin is compatible with **Autodesk Maya 2017** and later. 

Please follow the instructions provided here to install the **Babylon.js** exporter for **Autodesk Maya** https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/featuresDeepDive/Exporters/Maya

Until **Autodesk Maya** provides native support for **glTF** export the most comprehensive documentation for the **babylon.js** plugin and ideal Maya specifications are located here:

* *This documentation currently suggests bypassing ORM export from Maya and encourages using a 3D painting software such as Substance Painter or 3dCoat. In this case you can export your .glb+ORM Maps from your painting software and import directly to Second Life.*
